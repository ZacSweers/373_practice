1. It's a path to the python interpreter

2. # sign for block comments, triple quotes (like what surround this) for
    block comments.

3. No comma = it prints a new line. Comma = it doesn't.

4.
    - % python Hello.py

    - % chmod ugo+x Hello.py
      % Hello.py
      # - Remember it has to have the interpreter path put at the top.

    - % python
    # *enter interpreter*
    >>> import Hello

5. Use the help() command

    >>>help()

6. Checks to make sure n is greater than 0. Throws an assertion exception if it
    fails.

7. with the '-O' argument

    % python -O Assertions.py

8. Java can't have methods outside of classes. Closest thing is to have a
    static method within a class, which you can call without needing an
    instance of the class.

    i.e. you could call SomeClass.someMethod()

9. Collatz conjecture states that for any number of n, you repeat this algo
    and it will (for unproven reasons) eventually end at 1.

    n must be greater than 0
    if n is 1, cycle length is 1
    if n is even, divide by 2 and start over
    if n is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 (3n+1) and start over

10. Nope
